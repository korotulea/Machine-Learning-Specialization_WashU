<h1>Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach</h1>

<b>About the Course</b>

<p>In this course, students will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  At the end of the first course students will study how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, students will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.</p>

<p>This first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, students will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output.</p>

Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course, students will be able to: 
<ul>
<li>Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.</li>  
<li>Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.</li>
<li>Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.</li>
<li>Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.</li>
<li>Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models.</li> 
<li>Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.</li>
<li>Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.</li>
<li>Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.</li> 
<li>Implement these techniques in Python.</li>
</ul>
