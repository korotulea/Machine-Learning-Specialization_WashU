<h1>Machine Learning: Classification</h1>

<b>About the Course</b>

<p>Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction</p>

<p>In the first case study on analyzing sentiment, students will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In the second case study for this course, loan default prediction, students will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.</p>

<p>Students will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. Students will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, students will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent. Students will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks. Students will also address significant tasks from real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier. This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.</p>
