<h1>Machine Learning: Regression</h1>

<b>About the Course</b>

<p>Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices</p>

<p>In the first case study, predicting house prices, students will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.  Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.</p>

<p>In this course, students will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection. Students will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity. Students will also analyze the impact of aspects of data -- such as outliers -- on selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, students will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.</p>

Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course, students will be able to: 
<ul>
<li>Describe the input and output of a regression model.</li>  
<li>Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.</li>
<li>Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.</li>
<li>Tune parameters with cross validation.</li>
<li>Analyze the performance of the model.</li> 
<li>Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.</li>
<li>Deploy methods to select between models.</li>
<li>Exploit the model to form predictions.</li> 
<li>Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.</li>
<li>Implement these techniques in Python.</li>
</ul>
